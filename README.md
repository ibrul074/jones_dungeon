# Gold D Jones' Dungeon
The game consists of a hero that moves around a dungeon trying to collect as many points as possible from treasures while limiting the amount of traps he needs to step on (these will reduce his energy and points). He also has a sidekick that moves in the opposite direction that can transfer his points to the hero whenever they meet.
